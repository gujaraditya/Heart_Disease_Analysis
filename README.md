# Introduction:
Heart disease refers to any condition affecting the heart. This disease discribes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Heart diseases include:

• Blood vessel disease, such as coronary artery disease

• Heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias)

• Heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects)

• Heart valve disease

• Disease of the heart muscle

• Heart infection

# Business Problem:
In this project, the dataset has lot many features which gives many medical insights whether a person has a heart condition/ disease or not. Our objective for the binary classification problem is to build models to predict whether person with available feature has a heart disease or not.

# About Data:
Data set includes 13 features to predict target 0 or 1, where

1:heart disease

0: no heart condition

Below are the details for 13 features and one target columns in our datasets:

• age: The person’s age in years
• sex: The person’s sex (1 = male, 0 = female)

• cp: chest pain type

  Value 0: asymptomatic
  Value 1: atypical angina
  Value 2: non-anginal pain
  Value 3: typical angina
• trestbps: The person’s resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

• chol: The person’s cholesterol measurement in mg/dl

• fbs: The person’s fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)

• restecg: resting electrocardiographic results

  Value 0: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes’ criteria
  Value 1: normal
  Value 2: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
• thalach: The person’s maximum heart rate achieved exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

• oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (‘ST’ relates to positions on the ECG plot. See more here)

• slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

  0: downsloping; 1: flat; 2: upsloping

  0: downsloping; 1: flat; 2: upsloping

• ca: The number of major vessels (0–3)

• thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia Value 0: NULL (dropped from the dataset previously

  Value 1: fixed defect (no blood flow in some part of the heart)

  Value 2: normal blood flow

  Value 3: reversible defect (a blood flow is observed but it is not normal)
  
• target: Heart disease (1 = no, 0= yes)
